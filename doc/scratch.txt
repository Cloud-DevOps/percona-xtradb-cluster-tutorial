# initial vs working puppet
- set a manifest file for VagrantFile
- maybe just run script / different manifest file to shutdown all the services on the nodes and clear the datadirs and my.cnf?


# plan for getting people setup:
   - install/setup document
   - centos box on usb sticks at the meeting
