Percona XtraDB Cluster Tutorial
================================

This repository contains both Tutorial documentation organized into modules and actual Vagrant + Puppet configs to setup a Tutorial environment. This tutorial was written for Percona employees to give at conferences in either 3 or 6 hours sessions, but should be useful for anyone wanting to explore more about XtraDB Cluster and Galera.

Tutorial Students
------------------

If you are attending a conference tutorial, start with the *TL;DR* section of ``doc/00-Setup-Quick.rst``, as well as review that whole document and ``00-Tutorial-Process``.  

It is recommended you do these steps *before* the conference to maximize time the whole class has to do the actual exercises.


Individual Learners
---------------------

If you are not attending a conference tutorial, you may wish to start follow the Tutorial steps rigidly above, or just get the working environment setup and start poking around.  In either case, the ``doc/00-Setup-Quick.rst`` document for details on setting up the environment on the machine of your choosing.  

From there, all the documented modules under ``doc/`` are mostly self-contained, though some depend on previous steps modules to a degree.


Contributors
---------------------

This repository is free to branch, open issues on, and submit pull requests to.  

I've opened a set of issues for new modules to be written.  If you want to contribute, take the issue, branch the repo, do your changes, and submit a pull request.  I will make an effort now to use branches myself and keep the master branch clean apart from pull merges.

Any review/testing/proofreading you can do would be much appreciated.
